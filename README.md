# RocketDataVisualization

Welcome to Rocket Launches Data Visualization 🚀!

One can be a fantastic ML Engineer or Data Scientist, but that is only useful with efficiently communicating your results to any audience.

For this reason, I decided to take these first steps to master Data Visualization.

This repo presents the Kaggle dataset "All Space Missions from 1957" in a visual way.

Numerous libraries have been used to do so, including folium, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, etc.

Hope you enjoy your trip through the space! 🌌🪐👩‍🚀✨🌠
